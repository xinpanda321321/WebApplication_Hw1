        <h4>Professional Biography Format</h4>
        <br>
        <div>
          Think of a professional biography as an advertisement for yourself. The same rules that apply to advertisements apply to professional biographies, too - keep it brief, relevant, and engaging. Get started with a basic outline for an effective professional bio.
        </div>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li class="text-small shadow">Start with your full name. Explain what you do and how you do it well. You can also include some information about your early life. It's important to get your reader's attention quickly here.</li>
          <li class="text-small shadow">Describe a core professional belief or value. Prospective employers, clients, and readers want to know that you truly care about your work.</li>
          <li class="text-small shadow">List relevant employment experiences and successes. You've got your reader's attention - now it's time to prove that you are unique and exemplary in your field. Be specific.</li>
          <li class="text-small shadow">Include certifications, credentials, training, awards, or other practical experiences.</li>
          <li class="text-small shadow">Add your relevant degrees and schools. It's good to leave your audience with a sense of your educational accomplishments.</li>
          <li class="text-small shadow">Depending on your audience, you can end with a bit of humor, but keep it short.</li>
          <li class="text-small shadow">Write your professional biography in third person, as if you are writing about someone else.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>The typical length for a professional biography is five to ten sentences. It's tempting to add impressive facts to make your blurb longer, but err on the side of brevity. Audiences are more likely to read shorter and more relevant biographies than longer, drawn-out paragraphs.</div>

        <h3>Professional Biographies</h3>
        <br>
        <div>The information you include depends on your professional industry. A college student may not have as much experience as a doctor, but they are probably writing to different audiences. Here are some examples of professional biographies in different industries.</div>
        <br>
        <h4>Teacher</h4>
        <div>A teacher may include their professional biography at the top of a class syllabus or on their school website. Their audience consists of students, parents, colleagues, and school administration.</div>
        <br>
        <h4>Writer</h4>
        <div>Even before they are published authors, writers need a strong professional biography on their social media pages and websites. They also need to submit short blurbs about themselves when they submit work for publication. Like other project-based professions, it's beneficial for writers to include their current or next projects in their biographies.</div>
        <br>
        <h4>Project Manager</h4>
        <div>Employers in all industries want to hire project managers to keep their companies running smoothly. A project manager should focus on skills and abilities in their professional development, as well as professional accomplishments.</div>
